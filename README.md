# Films Watched

Site containing a list of movies I watched for the last decade.

## Implementation

I'm using the npm package `gsjson` to fetch data from my Google spreadsheet where I actually track this stuff. 
Then I munge it together with the client code using the Gulpfile.

## Running

Use the update data shell script. Make sure Node is on version 10.x only.
